Builds R libraries. Includes checks for consistency.
}
\details{
This function is designed to help building R libraries. It performs the
following steps: \itemize{
\item Version: Determination of a new version number (Can also be defined by the user).
\item Date: Determination of a the date of the build (Can also be defined by the user).
\item Linter: Check for code style problems.
\item R check: Check whether the library is consistent and can be built.
\item Package building: Builds the .zip and .tar.gz packages under windows.
Under linux, only the .tar.gz package is built. }
The commit has to be performed by the user still.
